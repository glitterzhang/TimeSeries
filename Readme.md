GRE WRITING
What is offered as evidence, support, or proof
what is explicitly stated, claimed, or concluded
what is assumed or supposed, perhaps without justification or proof
what is not stated, but necessarily follows from what is stated

In addition, you should consider the structure of the argument — the way in which these elements are linked together to form a line of reasoning; that is, you should recognize the separate, sometimes implicit steps in the thinking process and consider whether the movement from each one to the next is logically sound. In tracing this line, look for transition words and phrases that suggest that the author is attempting to make a logical connection (e.g., however, thus, therefore, evidently, hence, in conclusion)

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation/advice/prediction and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation.

Write a response in which you discuss one or more alternative explanations that could rival the proposed explanation and explain how your explanation(s) can plausibly account for the facts presented in the argument






OG P29
It might be true that investing more money on could attract more use on riverside recreational facilities. However, there are many assumptions and flaws hidden in the course of reasoning that could make the argument unconvincing.
This augment states that city park department use little of its budget for the maintenance of river recreational facilities. However, it does not clarify the “little”. Probably the city park department has devoted sufficient budget to river recreational facilities.  Even though it might be true that the city park department does not spend lots of money on river recreational facilities, the reason for doing this is unstated. The city park department might invest a lot at the beginning. But after they realize the people rarely use them, the city park department decided to reduce it.
The author argues that the decreased use in riverside recreational facilities results from the pollution of the river, which complained by residents. While a polluted river could drop the recreational activities on river, the connection between these two factors is not effectively made. This argument assumes that the complaints are provided by a wide range and numerous residents.  But we don’t know how many or how much percentage of residents complained about the quality of river, and how many of the residents who is upset with the river would use river for water sports. It is possible that many complaints come from only one or two residents. The residents who complaints about the river’s smell could just put more attention on the quality of environment but never do water sports.

Additionally, the author indicates that the state plans to clean up the river, which will increase the recreational use on this river. This implication is based on the assumption that the condition of river could be improved and the quality of river is the only factor that could limit the use for recreational activities. The cause of water pollution may be both natural and anthropogenic. If the contamination come from sewage or liquid waste of household or industries, we might be able to improve the quality of river by control the source of pollution. But what if it come from nature or we don’t know the reason of pollution? Suppose we can improve the quality of river.  It is not strong enough to say the recreational use of river will increase.  We don’t know if the river is good for swimming, boating or fishing, since there is no evidence to show people had used this river for recreation activities before.

With above assumptions and insufficient evidence, the conclusion that government should invest more money to riverside recreational facilities is not solid. To strength the argument, the author need to prove more concrete and compelling evidence.

It is true that sharing rides could help with reduce the traffic problem somehow. However, the evidence provided in this argument is not strong enough to conclude that Waymarsh should take the policy to reduce commuting time of people.
Comparing two survey of which one is from 3 years ago, the other one is now, the author is suggesting that traffic is becoming worse in Waymarsh recently.  However, without explaining how these two survey conducted and if the sample selected are adequate or representative, the result from survey could be questionable. We don’t know the sample size of each survey. If the survey conducted 3 years is only base on 10 people. But this year, 100 people answer this survey. It does not make sense to compare the result and the first survey is not valid, since the minimum sample size is 30 in statistics. On the other hand, the author need evidence to prove there is not selection bias on survey sample. It is possible that the commuters who took survey 3 years ago live close to their workplace, and the commuters investigated this year live far from their office. Thus, the number of driving time is tenuous if we don’t explain the way of survey.
Building upon the implication of worse traffic, the author bring up one solution to improve the traffic by constructing more road. But this strategy was excluded in this argument by indicating that the construction program of road would disrupt resident’s live.  To prove the inaccessibility of building road, we need more evidence that only the road that close to residential area can help with traffic. If the traffic happen on highway which is far away from house, why would we building local road?
Excluding the possibility of road construction, the author states that the reward policy for ride-sharing implemented in Garville had decrease the pollution and driving time, indicating that Waymarsh should take this policy. While rider sharing is a good program, the evidence to prove the benefits of ride-sharing and the necessary to implement in Waymarsh is not sound.  The dropped pollution probably is not mainly caused from the reward policy. It is possible of the pollution is getting better recently due to some other punishment policy come from government or the stronger awareness of environment.  It could be true that for some for commuter who take the ride of their friend, their driving time is less. However, the people who need to pick up the riders might take longer time for driving. We don’t know the average timme for each commuter. In addition, even if it bring benefits to Garville, it does not mean it will work for Waymarsh. 

Without showing sufficient and compelling evidence, it is hard to establish the connection between reward program and improving traffic, even though it is a good idea.

Education :
3.  Educational institutions have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed.

Students:
Child, 
Space to explore their interest. Innovation, creative thinking. Indian movie- boy who has mental disease gift on painting.

Adolescent
They like computer games

College students- Education/faculty know more than students, essay- research area.
However, 
Some student have gift
Many student couldn’t find what they would like to even when they graduate from school, which is a misery, since too much dissuasion. 
Base on the student condition, more likely to succeed not best choice.  If could undermine diversity of students
